! don't have their own firmware where I can remap keys for the physical
! keyboard.
! Such keyboards need software to remap Caps Lock to Super.

! Remove caps lock key (66) from the "lock" modifier. Now it's a basic key that
! does nothing.
clear Lock

! Instead use the keycode, which is the same on every system I've ever tried
! this on.
! keysym Caps_Lock = Super_L
keycode 66 = Super_L
