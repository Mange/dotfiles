This directory will try to document my different keybindings.

## Base layout

I use an Anne Pro 60% keyboard that looks like this (with my custom layout set):

Hyper is my own modifier that is added using `Xmodmap`; it does not exist on
other keyboard layouts. It is meant to be a key that I know no app will be
using unless I bind to it, and I have it reserved for "global" shortcuts, like
dealing with my window manager, etc.

## Hyper keybinds

When holding Hyper, the following shortcuts become available:

| Color   | Modifiers                                         |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Red     | <kbd>Hyper</kbd>                                  |
| Yellow  | <kbd>Hyper</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd>                 |
| Blue    | <kbd>Hyper</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>                  |

This cheatsheet can be shown on the current screen with
<kbd>Hyper</kbd>Â <kbd>?</kbd>.
