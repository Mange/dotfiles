DOTFILES
========

About this
----------
This is a git repository for my personal dotfiles, e.g. configuration files for *NIX systems.

Please note that this repository is very personal, and small changes might be added all the time. If you want to use this for yourself and are not a mental clone of me, you'd want to fork this and marge back changes you like and ignore those you hate. If you have proposals for my repo, just do a pull request so I can check it out.

Preference bias
---------------
I'm biased towards Ruby, ZSH, tmux, Git and VIM so most configurations should be inline with this ecosystem. I use both Linux and Mac systems so no preference will be taken there.

Installation
------------
 * Begin by cloning this repository somewhere on your machine, for example ~/dotfiles.
 * `rake install`
 * You're done!

Any files found conflicting will be backed up. Check the output of the installer.
