Downloads the given URL and stores it cached somewhere on disk. The same URL
will not be downloaded again if already downloaded.

After the image has been downloaded, the path is printed to STDOUT. If download
failed, nothing will be printed and the script will exit with an error
statuscode.

After a certain number of images have been downloaded, the oldest ones will
start to be deleted. This will happen in the background.
