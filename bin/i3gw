# i3-msg has an undocumented function (open) that creates
# empty containers, or as I call them: ghosts.
# Since these empty containers doesn't contain any windows
# there is no instance/class/title to identify them, making
# it difficult to control them. They do however have a con_id and
# I found the easiest way to keep track of the ghosts is to
# mark them. That is what this script does, it creates a ghost
# get its con_id and mark it.
# 
# usage:
# i3gw MARK
# 
# example:
# i3gw casper
# 
# this will create a ghost marked casper, you can perform any action
# you can perform on a regular container.
# 
# example:
# i3-msg [con_mark=casper] move to workspace 2
# i3-msg [con_mark=casper] split v
# i3-msg [con_mark=casper] layout tabbed
# i3-msg [con_mark=casper] kill
# 
# the last example (kill), destroys the container.
