Usage: $0 COMMAND [ARGâ€¦]
   or: $0 --print
   or: $0 --debug

Tries to run COMMAND in the same CWD as the currently focused window. Will
start in \$HOME if CWD cannot be determined.

With --print option, no command will run. Instead the path that would be used
as CWD for a command is printed to stdout.

With the --debug option, much more output will be printed. It will print a list
of all checked processes.

# List all pids running in this window; for example a terminal might be running
# a shell that is running an editor.
# There's always a risk that the deepest process is short-lived (maybe it's
# running this script itself, after all, which would match the "pstree" command
# below), so iterate each process (but in reverse order) until a working PID is
# found.
#
# -T hides threads so we can focus on processes only.
# -p shows pid.
# -A uses ASCII trees, so it's easier to split the list and pick the last process.
#
# pstree might look like this:
# kitty(21645)---zsh(21650)-+-cat(27539)
#                           `-samedir(27538)---pstree(27547)
#
# Use sed to split it so at most one process is on each line, then strip out
# everything that isn't a number.
#
# Then use tac to reverse the order.
#
# Then check each one for a valid CWD and continue when one is found.
