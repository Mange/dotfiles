! Caps Lock = Hyper
! This configuration binds the keycode for caps lock (66) directly to Hyper_L
! instead of trying to reassign Caps_Lock to Hyper_L. This is needed because
! something on my system is already redefining 66 to Escape, so no Caps_Lock is
! even defined. This should actually work as well on a system that has done
! nothing to Caps_Lock already. I leave "clear Lock" for those systems.
