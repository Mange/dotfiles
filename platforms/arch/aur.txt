# I fucking hate Node
# I don't want it, but I need it for other software and it refuses to
# follow XDG. One can force it to do so, but then nvm does not work and
# I need nvm on one of my machines as a dependency. So now it needs to
# infect all my systems.
# Fuck Node and all the shit that spawned from it. A fucking mistake
# on the face of the earth is what it is.
